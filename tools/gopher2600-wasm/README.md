# gopher2600-wasm

Builds the app's preview emulator: [github.com/jetsetilly/gopher2600](https://github.com/jetsetilly/gopher2600)'s
emulation core (real DPC+/CDF ARM-coprocessor support included, zero cgo)
compiled to WebAssembly. The output is vendored build output, not built as
part of `npm run build` - same convention as `public/bb19`'s WASM binaries.

## Why `vendor/` instead of a normal module dependency

gopher2600's repository is ~1.3GB (it bundles large test-fixture ROMs/assets
unrelated to the emulation core itself), which exceeds the Go module proxy's
zip size limit (`create zip: module source tree too large`). `go get` /
`go build` against it directly does not work. Instead, this directory vendors
*only the Go source actually imported* (`vendor/`, ~3MB) via a temporary
local `replace` directive during vendoring - see the comment on that
directive in `go.mod` for why it's safe to leave the (non-portable, points at
a throwaway local clone) path in place afterward: `-mod=vendor` builds never
read from it, they only check it matches `vendor/modules.txt` for
consistency.

## Local changes to the vendored gopher2600

`vendor/` is gopher2600 v0.57.2 with two local patches, kept in `patches/` so they can
be reapplied after a re-vendor (`git apply patches/*.patch`):

- `0001-vcs-step-no-closure-allocation.patch`: `VCS.Step()` built a new closure for
  every CPU instruction, which escaped to the heap (about 6,700 allocations per frame)
  and called a do-nothing callback three times per cycle. The cycle function is now a
  method built once. About 8% faster natively and about 6% in WASM.
- `0002-sprite-tick-reports-change-only-when-busy.patch`: the player, missile and ball
  `tick()` returned true on every color clock, so `Video.Pixel()` never took its early
  return. They now report a change only while drawing, latching or with an event
  scheduled (register writes already flag a change themselves). Rendered frames and
  audio hash identically to the unpatched core on every ROM tried (the `pgo-profile`
  harness prints a frame hash); about 2% faster natively, since Pixel was a smaller share
  than its profile suggested.

The television's frame limiter is switched off in `main.go` (`tv.SetFPSLimit(false)`):
left on, it padded every frame to a full 16.7 ms wait, and the page paces the
emulator instead.

## Rebuilding (e.g. to pick up a gopher2600 update)

```bash
# 1. Get a full local clone (shallow is fine, still ~1.3GB) and point the
#    replace directive in go.mod at it:
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jetsetilly/gopher2600.git /tmp/gopher2600-src
# edit go.mod's replace line to point at that path

go mod tidy
go mod vendor
git apply patches/*.patch   # the local changes described above
# revert the replace line's path back to a placeholder if desired - it's
# never dereferenced by normal -mod=vendor builds, see go.mod's comment

# 2. Build the WASM artifact and copy the matching JS glue:
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -mod=vendor -ldflags="-s -w" \
  -gcflags='github.com/jetsetilly/gopher2600/...=-l -l -l -l' -gcflags='main=-l -l -l -l' \
  -o ../../public/js/gopher2600.wasm .
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" ../../public/js/wasm_exec.js
```

## Profile-guided optimization

`default.pgo` is a CPU profile Go uses automatically (`-pgo=auto` is its default) to inline and
de-virtualize the hot per-clock code. It made a frame about 11% faster (11.9 ms to 10.6 ms in the
browser, alternating runs of a brick-breaker ROM; 8% on a title-screen ROM). The profile covers a
title screen, a reference ROM and a game played with scripted joystick input. Regenerate it after a gopher2600 update or a change to
the frame loop in `main.go` by running ROMs natively under pprof, then rebuild:

```bash
go run -mod=vendor ./pgo-profile default.pgo path/to/game.bin path/to/another.bin
```

The `-l -l -l -l` gcflags raise the compiler's inlining effort for the emulator packages and
`main` (the flag is borrowed from JetSetIlly's Gopher2600-Utils `ebiten_test/webserve.sh`). Natively
it made a frame about 2% faster and the RGBA conversion loop about twice as fast. Do not apply it
to every package (`all=`): the Go runtime does not compile with it. `-B` (no bounds checks) was
about 4% faster too but turns an out-of-range index into silent memory corruption, so it is not used.

Converting a frame to RGBA uses a 256-entry color table per TV standard (rebuilt when the
standard changes; SECAM keeps the per-pixel call because its colors depend on the line above)
and writes each pixel as one 32-bit store. That took the conversion from about 270 us to about
40 us per frame natively, with identical output (the `pgo-profile` frame hash matches). The
table logic is duplicated in `pgo-profile/main.go`.

Tried and not kept: `GOWASM=satconv,signext` (no change in speed or size, the Go toolchain
already uses them), an `int32` signal index in the television (2-3% slower), and `-B` (about 4%
faster in WASM, but see above). Audio was not changed: skipping it while silent would change the
channel state the sound starts from.

Raising the GC threshold (`debug.SetGCPercent`) made no measurable difference once the
per-instruction allocation was gone, so it is not set.

## wasm-opt

Binaryen's `wasm-opt -O3` is deliberately not applied: it makes the file about 1 MB
smaller but the emulator about 2% slower (11.1 ms per frame against 10.9 ms, both with
the allocation patch, alternating runs in the same browser page). If you try it anyway, pass the feature flags explicitly
(`--enable-bulk-memory --enable-nontrapping-float-to-int --enable-sign-ext
--enable-mutable-globals --enable-multivalue`): `--all-features` makes newer Binaryen
write a compact-imports section browsers reject ("Invalid import kind 126").

## How the page runs it

The emulator runs in a web worker (`public/js/gopher2600-worker.js`), not on the
page's main thread, so a frame that takes 12-17 ms to emulate never blocks the UI.
`main.go` has no DOM access: the worker script provides `g2kBlank`, `g2kPostFrame`,
`g2kPostAudio` and `g2kReady` for it to call, and the page (`public/index.html`)
draws the frames it posts, plays the audio, forwards keyboard events and sends
one "tick" per display refresh. The worker turns those ticks into a steady 60
frames per second at any monitor refresh rate (50 for PAL).

Requires a Go toolchain (this was built with Go 1.27) - only for whoever
rebuilds this artifact, not for the app's normal `npm install`/`npm run build`.
