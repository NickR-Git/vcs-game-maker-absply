// Keep in sync with --blockly-font-family in App.vue's  global <style>

// font everywhere else is unaffected, only Blockly's block/flyout text uses
// this one) - there's no build-time bridge between a CSS custom property
// and this JS theme config, so the two have to be updated together by hand.
// Blockly
// measures every block's  text width at layout time using ITS
// font-metrics call (a hidden canvas context, not the DOM/CSS engine), so
// switching the app's font via CSS alone (see App.vue's .blocklyText
// override) left Blockly still measuring block width as if the text were
// still in its  default (11pt sans-serif) - text rendered in the new,
// often-wider font then visibly overran the space Blockly had reserved for
// it, overlapping whatever field/input came right after (confirmed
// directly: "plus" on the "every X frames" block overlapping its  value
// field, "to" on "change state to" overlapping its dropdown). Registering
// the real font here instead means Blockly's  measurement uses it from
// the start, so block width is computed correctly to begin with - the CSS
// override above is then mostly redundant for block text specifically) but
// still needed for the toolbox/flyout labels here, which use this same
// theme's fontStyle too.

  // Briefly tried Blockly.Themes.Zelos as the base here (paired with the
  // Zelos renderer) - that made every stock block relying on its  3-tone
  // colourPrimary/Secondary/Tertiary style (e.g. controls_if's
  // "logic_blocks" style) render solid black, since Zelos's  blockStyles

    // (parses as several single-word fallback names instead of one), so the
    // canvas silently measured against its default font instead, producing
    // a NARROWER width than the real font actually renders at - confirmed
    // as the real reason "block width is computed correctly to begin with"
    // (this comment's claim, right above) wasn't actually true: text
