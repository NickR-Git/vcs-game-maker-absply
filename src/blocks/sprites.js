// variable name, so this is written once and called twice rather than
// hand-duplicated.
//
// Single extension covering BOTH concerns every combined block needs from
// its  dropdown field - Blockly.Block.prototype.setOnChange (see its
// JSDoc) REPLACES any prior onchange handler rather than composing with it,
// so this can't be split into two separate registered extensions (one per
// concern) the way it reads more naturally; every block gets exactly one
// 'extensions' entry pointing here instead.
//
// 1. Colour - index0 (Player 0/Missile 0) = red, index1 (Player 1/
//    Missile 1) = blue, the exact colours the old separate per-name blocks
//    used to be, before they were combined into one type each (confirmed
//    with the user: still wanted that same visual distinction, just driven
//    by the dropdown now instead of by which block type was dragged out).
//    Applied once immediately (a block's  initial colour, from its JSON
//    'colour' key, is only ever right for the dropdown's default value) and
//    again on every change.
// 2. VAR sync (only for blocks that actually have a VAR field - get/set/
//    change) - keeps VAR showing a valid, correctly-translated option after
//    the dropdown changes. Without this, switching e.g. Player 0 -> Player 1
//    on an existing block would leave VAR holding a stale "player0..."
//    value that isn't even one of the (now player1-prefixed) options being
//    shown. Translates the SAME property across (player0x -> player1x, not
//    silently resetting back to X every time) when the old value still has
//    the expected prefix; otherwise leaves it alone.
//
// Registered as a VALIDATOR directly on the dropdown field, not via
// Blockly.Block.prototype.setOnChange - confirmed as a real reported bug:
// setOnChange only ever fires from a real Blockly.Events.BlockChange event,
// and Blockly suppresses event firing entirely while a block is being
// built from XML with events disabled (see Field.prototype.setValue's
// "if (source && Blockly.Events.isEnabled())" guard in node_modules/
// blockly/core/field.js) - which is exactly how every TOOLBOX FLYOUT block
// is constructed (Blockly.Xml.domToBlock, called with events off for
// performance), so a block placed in the toolbox XML with e.g.
// `<field name="PLAYER">1</field>` never fired the change this relied on
// and stayed whatever colour PLAYER's  JSON default resolved to. A
// field's LOCAL VALIDATOR (this.getValidator()/setValidator()), by
// contrast, is called unconditionally from inside setValue() itself,
// BEFORE that same events-enabled check - runs every single time, XML load
// or live user edit alike. Field.prototype.setValue's  oldValue read
// happens AFTER the validator runs but BEFORE the new value is committed,
// so the validator's `this.getValue()` (this = the field) is still the
// OLD value at the point it runs, and the validator's  newValue
// parameter is the incoming one - exactly the {old, new} pair this used to
// read off the (unreliable) BlockChange event instead.
//
// VAR's  getOptions() (no cache arg) has to run BEFORE its setValue() -
// same gotcha blocks/bit.js's  refreshVariableDropdownValue documents:
// the dropdown's dynamic options are cached until something invalidates
// them, and setValue()'s  validation reads whatever's cached, so
// skipping the fresh getOptions() call would just validate the translated
// value against the OLD option list instead of the new one.
// Exported - blocks/input.js's combined Joystick 0/1 blocks reuse this
// directly (same "dropdown drives colour + optional VAR-prefix translate"
// shape) rather than duplicating it.
