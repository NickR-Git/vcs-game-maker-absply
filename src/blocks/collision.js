// One-frame-delayed hardware-collision "backtrack" check - no movement
// and no extra drawscreen: bBasic's kernel already clears the
// TIA collision latches every frame as part of "drawscreen" (its version of
// CXCLR), and its "collision()" builtin already wraps reading them
// (CXP0FB/CXP1FB) - so checking collision() at the START of a frame, BEFORE
// this frame's movement blocks run, reads the result of LAST frame's
// movement and undoes it if it collided. Place this ahead of whatever
// joystick/movement blocks already move the player (e.g. from the Sprites
// category) in the same event - it only backs up and restores position, it
// never moves the player itself.
//
// This checks X and Y together (both revert if either axis collided), not
// separately - CXP0FB/CXP1FB is a single combined bit with no way to tell
// which axis caused the overlap, so per-axis wall sliding isn't possible
// with this technique by itself. A software (pfread-based) axis-aware
// version of this was tried and reverted after causing two separate real
// bugs on an actual project (a ROM lockup, then - even after fixing that - a
// hard crash on contact) - see generators/bbasic/collision.js's
// top-of-file comment for the full account. This version is simpler and
// known-correct: it stops dead at a wall instead of sliding along it.

// A predictive (check-BEFORE-moving) software playfield collision block

// "Sprite With Collision Prevention" example (AtariAge), was tried here and
// removed again - real testing found it reported collisions against pixels
// the player wasn't actually near, even after fixing two earlier bugs found
// along the way (a row-height formula that didn't scale with this project's
// Superchip pfres, and a compound "&&"-plus-nested-"if" condition never
// actually proven to compile correctly). Root cause not isolated before the
// approach was abandoned in favor of adapting this app's already-working
// built-in "background collision" example blocks (hardware collision_get,
// checked one-frame-delayed - see collision_check_position above) instead of
// continuing to chase custom pfread() box math. See git history on this file
// and on generators/bbasic/collision.js for the full account.
