// background_fade_to (see generators/bbasic/background.js) is a fire-and-
// forget TRIGGER, not a "call every frame yourself" block - it writes its
// target/pace once, and a per-frame check spliced into commongamelogic (see
// generateBackgroundFadeChecks) does the actual stepping from then on,
// exactly like sound effect fades (generateEnvelopeChecks in generators/
// bbasic/soundfx.js) and music event watches (generateMusicChecks) already
// do. This matters because a fade triggered from inside an "if" block (e.g.
// "if joystick fire") only has its trigger code re-run while that
// condition holds - a single brief tap wouldn't re-enter it on later
// frames, so an earlier "advance one step per call" design silently stalled
// after one step once nested that way (confirmed as a real bug: the fade
// only ever completed when its trigger sat unconditionally at the main
// loop's top level, re-running it every frame by construction).
//
// FADE_STEPS is fixed at 4, not user-choosable - see its  comment below
// for why.
//
// One set of dev vars per target register (COLUBK/COLUPF), only reserved
// when a fade block actually targets that register:
//  - backgroundFadeTimerVarName: frames remaining until the next brightness
//    step, reloaded from backgroundFadePaceVarName each time it fires.
//  - backgroundFadePaceVarName: the reload value itself (frames requested /
//    FADE_STEPS) - stored rather than recomputed each frame, since it
//    depends on the FRAMES input, which can be an arbitrary runtime
//    expression, not just a compile-time constant.
//  - backgroundFadeTargetVarName: the full target color byte (hue in bits
//    7-4, target brightness in bits 3-1) - stored rather than reading the
//    trigger block's  VALUE input again later, since the check runs from
//    a single shared function with no block of its  to read an input
//    from.
// backgroundFadeIncrementVarName isn't needed either, for the same reason
// FADE_STEPS is fixed: with only one possible step count project-wide,
// every fade on a given register shares the exact same brightness
// increment, so it can be baked into generateBackgroundFadeChecks as a
// literal instead of costing its  dev var.
// The brightness itself isn't tracked in its  dev var at all - it's read
// fresh from the live shadow color variable (backgroundrealcolor/
// playfieldrealcolor) every check instead, specifically to avoid a real bug
// an earlier version of this had: a separate brightness tracker defaulting
// to 0 made a "fade down"-only block snap straight to black on its very
// first call, regardless of whatever color was actually on screen.
// Generalized past just COLUBK/COLUPF - scorecolor (score.js's
// score_fade_to) and TextColor (text-minikernel.js's
// text_minikernel_fade_to) share this exact same stepping mechanism, since
// they're ordinary Atari color bytes with the identical hue/brightness
// nibble layout. Unlike COLUBK/COLUPF, neither needs a separate "shadow"
// variable (see generateBackgroundFadeChecks'  targetShadowVar comment in
// generators/bbasic/background.js) - nothing else overwrites scorecolor or
// TextColor every frame the way the score/text drawing routines overwrite
// COLUBK/COLUPF, so the real variable itself doubles as its  shadow.
// player0realcolor/player1realcolor (sprites.js's  sprite_player_fade_to)
// share this same mechanism too, feeding COLUP0/COLUP1 - see
// generateBackgroundFadeChecks'  isShadowedRegister check for why these
// two DO need nameDB_ resolution (like COLUBK/COLUPF), unlike scorecolor/
// TextColor. Fading either one also fades that player's  missile
// (missile0/missile1) for free: real 2600 hardware has no separate missile
// color register at all - missile0 always draws in COLUP0, missile1 in
// COLUP1, the exact same registers Player 0/1's  color already lives in.

// Fixed at 4 (not a user-choosable STEPS dropdown, as an earlier version of

// compiles to a cheap bit-shift, never the real "jsr div8" subroutine call
// a non-power-of-2 divisor (3, 5, 6, 7) needs (see generateDivMul's
// comment in generators/bbasic.js). That call is only safe from wherever
// div_mul.asm itself got inlined (always bank 1) - fine from
// generateBackgroundFadeChecks (always in commongamelogic, never
// relocated), but NOT fine from this block's  trigger, which lives
// wherever the user's  blocks place it, potentially a relocated event
// bank in a larger project. Confirmed as a real bug: a large enough
// project to relocate an event crashed (a stray audio tone, i.e. a
// runaway program counter) specifically whenever a non-power-of-2 STEPS
// was chosen. 4 is also the highest step count that's actually distinct
// from lower ones on this hardware (see FADE_STEPS's  increment-math
