// different card, frame, or animation - each a separate PixelEditor.vue
// instance) used to silently reset back to Pencil, since each instance's
// "toggledTool" data property independently defaulted to it - reported
// as a real bug: picking Eraser, then clicking into a different frame,
// meant drawing there with what LOOKED like Eraser still selected on the
// shared toolbar actually erased nothing until Eraser was clicked again.
// A single shared ref fixes both halves of that at once: the toolbar's
// highlighted button now reflects one true value instead of whichever
// instance happens to be focused, and a freshly-focused instance picks up
// that same value immediately (see PixelEditor.vue's initEditor) instead of
// requiring a fresh click before drawing actually uses it.

// corners). Shared by every PixelEditor.vue instance like toggledTool above, and
// switched by the two buttons in GraphicEditorToolbar.vue.
