// tab that has such a list. Each reorder is recorded with a way to put the previous order back
// and a way to redo it; the Undo and Redo buttons and shortcuts of the tab being shown try this
// first (see GraphicEditorToolbar.vue, DataEditor.vue, MusicEditor.vue, SoundFXEditor.vue and
// TextEditor.vue).
//
// A reorder only counts on the tab (route) it was made on, and only while the list still holds
// the order that reorder produced: if cards were added or deleted since, the entry is dropped
// rather than put back an order that no longer fits.
//
// Edits that have an undo of their own are noted with noteEdit(), so a reorder is undone first
// only when it is the most recent thing done on the tab. After one of those edits is undone
// (settleEdits) the reorders made before it are reachable again.
