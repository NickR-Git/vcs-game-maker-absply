// Converting a sound between the two kinds of sound the app makes.

// A Standard kernel sound is a TIA sound: a distortion type (AUDC) and a frequency divider (AUDF). The DPC+ kernel
// plays a sound with its music chip instead: a 32 sample waveform and a frequency in Hz (the chip's frequency table
// can hold any pitch). A DPC+ sound keeps its Standard settings (audc, audf) next to the DPC+ ones (dpcShape,
// dpcFrequency), so switching a project between kernels and back gives the same sound it started as.
//
// dpcShape names the waveform: 'tia<N>' is the waveform the TIA makes for AUDC N, which is what a converted sound
// uses and the only kind that can be turned back into a Standard sound.
