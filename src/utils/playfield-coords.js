// playfield column conversions use (x - 17) / 4), regardless of pfres/Superchip
// - exact, no project config needed. Measured on the emulator: a full-width
// background is 128 pixels wide. This used to be 5 (160 / 32), which made the
// Background editor's canvas too wide for its height.

// ball one color clock earlier than a player - so its left edge is at pixel x - 2

// those only agree once Superchip's  pfres is active (effectiveBackgroundRows
// returns cfg.pfres verbatim there). The non-Superchip default is different:
// batari Basic's  IMPLICIT pfres there is 12 (11 VISIBLE rows + 1 hidden
// scroll row - see DEFAULT_BACKGROUND_ROWS's  comment in blocks/
// background.js), but effectiveBackgroundRows deliberately returns just the
// visible 11. Dividing 96 by that visible-only 11 gave 9, not the real
// kernel's  96/12 = 8 - confirmed wrong directly against the reference
// docs'  worked numbers (player0y's documented 1-88 usable range implies
// 11 rows * 8 scanlines = 88, not 11 * 9 = 99), a real reported bug in the
