// (playfieldbase = var0's address), so those "var" slots aren't safe to use -
// only 26 single letters are available, and these 12 claim most of them.
//
// With Superchip enabled, the playfield buffer moves to the separate SARA
// chip RAM page instead, freeing var0-var43 (plus var44-var47, which are
// always free). Moving these system variables into var0-11 there instead of
// letters frees all 26 letters for user variables - see generateSystemDims
// and the letter pool below. var12-var43 (still unused even then) is where
// every OTHER dev/user variable goes first instead, before falling back to
// the letter pool - see SUPERCHIP_VAR_START and generateSuperchipVarDims.
//
// "loopcounter" (the "Repeat X times" block's  for-loop variable) and
// channnel0duration/channnel1duration (the sound-effect-duration/AUDV-auto-
// silence timers) used to live here too, unconditionally - both moved out to
// normal conditionally-reserved dev vars instead (see REPEAT_COUNTER_VAR_NAME
// in generators/bbasic/loops.js, reserved only when this.repeatLoopUsed, and
// this.channelDurationUsed's  pre-scan in init(), which also gates
// generateChannelDurationChecks below), since unlike every entry actually
// left here, neither is needed by every project: a project with zero
// "Repeat" blocks, or zero "Play sound" blocks and no music, was paying for
// these letters (or Superchip var0-14 slots) for nothing. Every var still
// listed below IS genuinely unconditional - each one gets written by a
// plain, unconditional line in the fixed per-frame template
// (bbasic.bb.hbs) itself, not by a block the user may or may not have used
// (confirmed directly for each: player0realcolor/player1realcolor/
// player0size/player1size restore COLUP0/COLUP1/NUSIZ0/NUSIZ1 every frame
// regardless, since the standard kernel's  score-digit drawing hijacks
// those same registers; framecounter increments every frame as a general-
// purpose fallback several OTHER features default to; player0frame/
// player1frame/player0animation/player1animation/newbackground are real
// batari Basic kernel identifiers the standard kernel itself requires to
// exist for ANY sprite/background to render at all).
// Third element of each entry is a very short description of why it's
// reserved - kept as real data (not just a JS comment) so generateSystemDims
// below can also emit it as a "rem" line right above the matching "dim" in
// the actual generated bBasic code, not just here in this source file.
// Listed in ascending letter order (l through z) - not grouped by feature the
// way an earlier version of this was - so the generated "dim" lines (see
// generateSystemDims below, which maps this array in order) and the ROM
// capacity display's "System reserved" list (hooks/rom.js's
// computeVariableUsage, same array/same order) both read as a straight a-z
// sequence, and a Superchip build's  var0-var11 numbering (also this
// array's  position, see generateSystemDims/backgroundRealColorRawTarget)
// follows that exact same order. Every other lookup here (findIndex by name)
// already adapts automatically to whatever order this array declares, so
// reordering it is safe by itself - nothing hardcodes a specific index.

  // entirely (as every non-1 bank was, for a project small enough that
  // nothing ever needed relocating) comes out short in the assembled

  // Confirmed directly: a blank Superchip project (nothing to relocate, so
  // every bank past 1 used to just vanish from the source) assembled
  // "successfully" into a truncated file Javatari couldn't make sense of -
  // it never reported a compile error, since nothing here checks the
  // assembled size against the declared ROM size either.
  //
  // Only the highest bank needs forcing, not every unused one in between -

  // MIDDLE bank (nothing relocated there) still comes out the right total
  // size as long as some LATER bank's  ORG gets opened; only the very
  // last bank has nothing after it to force that padding. Originally this
  // forced every bank 2..maxBanks unconditionally, which is what a blank
  // project needs (bank maxBanks is the only one that matters there
  // either, since nothing else ever gets opened) - but for a large,
  // heavily-relocated project, forcing empty stub sections for banks nothing
  // was ever assigned to needlessly adds more "bank N ... bank 1"
  // transitions than the project actually needs, each one a spot the
  // vendored compiler's  bank-splitting bookkeeping has to track -

// Builds the run-once flag bytes' per-frame reset body - registered as the

// generateRunOnceEdgeResetCall below, before generatedBody itself runs (the
// main loop's "gosub commongamelogic" happens before the per-frame game
// logic containing every "Run once" block) - has to run first so it's
// comparing against LAST frame's touched bits, not bits the current frame
// hasn't set yet. See blocks/event.js's event_run_once and its
// runOnceByteLetters comment in init() for the two-bit-per-instance,
// one-byte-per-4-instances "fired"/"touched" scheme this maintains (low
// nibble touched, high nibble fired): clears an instance's fired bit the
// instant it goes a whole frame without being touched (i.e. its enclosing
// condition just went false), so the very next activation fires again;
// leaves it alone for as long as the instance keeps being touched every
// frame (still the same activation).
//
// Nibble-aligned (not interleaved bit-pairs) specifically so this reset is
// two whole-byte shift/mask ops per byte regardless of how many of its 4
// instances are actually in use, instead of needing to unpack and re-pack
// each instance's  bit pair separately: temp1 takes the touched nibble
// as-is (already low-aligned); temp2 shifts the fired nibble down to
// low-aligned too, ANDs it against temp1 (clearing any fired bit whose
// touched counterpart is 0), then shifts the masked result back up - which
// also has the side effect of zeroing the low nibble, i.e. resetting every
// touched bit for the next frame's fresh tracking, for free.
// Hand-written 6502 instead of the 4-line-per-byte bB version this used to
// be - registered as an ordinary subroutine (see its  caller's comment),
// so this goes through normalizeIndents() same as _distance_abs_diff in
// input.js: bare "asm"/mnemonics with no leading whitespace (normalizeIndents
// adds one uniformly), "@end" (not a bare "end") to force the closing
// keyword back to column 0 the same way "@end" does there - the auto-
// appended bB "return" after this body needs the asm block actually closed
// first. "/16"/"*16" are power-of-2 CONSTANTS, so the real bB compiler
// already compiles those to inline shifts, not a div_mul.asm "jsr" (see
// generateDivMul's  comment on when that IS needed) - the actual saving
// here is smaller than that class of conversion elsewhere: each of the 4 bB
// statements this replaced reloaded its  operand from memory

  //

  //   landing on that stray byte, hence a black bottom row instead of the
  //   color that was meant to keep displaying there. Confirmed by compiling
  //   a test program and inspecting the generated assembly directly.
  //   Repeating the last row's color as a 12th entry gives that stray read
  //   a valid (and correct) value to land on.
  //
  // - "no_blank_lines" on: the missing 12th entry instead crushes the FIRST
  //   row's real display height down to a couple of scanlines, making it
  //   barely visible (confirmed by precise pixel sampling in the emulator).
  //   Duplicating the first row's color as an extra leading entry - keeping

// Builds what "Background scroll" needs to scroll the playfield colors with
// the pixels (see BACKGROUND_COLOR_SCROLL_SUBROUTINE_NAME in
// blocks/background.js). The kernel reads a row's color with
// "lda (pfcolortable),y", the table holding one color every 4 bytes, so
// scrolling the colors by a row is moving pfcolortable up 4 bytes.
//
// An indexed read that crosses a page boundary takes an extra cycle, and the
// kernel's timing has none to spare, so the pointer and everything it reaches
// have to be in one 256 byte page. A background can be much taller than that
// allows, so its colors are cut into pages: page p holds the colors of rows
// p * 16 and on (wrapping round to the first row after the last, which is how
// the playfield wraps) for as many rows as the kernel can read from a pointer
// anywhere in the first 16 rows of the page. To scroll to row k the pointer goes
// to page k / 16, 4 * (k mod 16) bytes in, and the same reads then land on the
// colors of rows k and on. The pages go in the fixed bank the kernel runs in
// (the "bank 1" data tables area), and the routine that sets the pointer
// carries its lookup tables with it, like bgscrollpatch.
//
// The kernel's table from "pfcolors:" (see buildPfcolorsBlock) holds the rows
// after the first (the first goes straight to COLUPF), starting one row
// further down when blank lines are shown, and the kernel starts reading it at
// pfcolortable + 132 - 4 * pfres (pfres being 12 without Superchip RAM). A page
// starts that many bytes (less 4 for the extra row) before its first entry, so
// the pointer is simply the page's address plus the offset. The top row's color
// goes in playfieldrealcolor (the value COLUPF is restored from every frame).

// The subroutine that makes scrolling past a customHeight background's
// first visibleRows rows actually work - see the comment above
// backgroundScrollPacking in blocks/background.js for the full account. Real pfscroll rotates
// the live window in place (cheap) but never loads a row that isn't already
// there, leaving exactly one row's worth of stale data behind per row-step;
// background_scroll's generator issues the pfscroll, detects when a row-step
// completed, sets temp5 (which window slot is stale) and temp3 (which row of
// the full background belongs there) and gosubs in here, which copies just
// that one row. A first attempt at this design failed in gameplay testing
// (partly from bugs found later, e.g. dispatching on the one-shot
// "newbackground" - see the reset block in generateBackgrounds); an
// interim version rewrote the whole window from a table on every row-step
// instead (after Scroll3A.bas), which worked but cost ~25x more per row-step
// on slow Superchip RAM.
//
// Builds one "playfield:" block per background in the project (not just the
// overflowing ones - see backgroundsWithOverflowRows' comment) so the
// dispatch always has something to read from, however the project happens
// to be using background_scroll - the exact same readable "X."-pixel-row
// text format (convertPlayfield/matrixToPlayfield) every OTHER "playfield:"
// block in this codebase already uses, not a hand-rolled hex-byte "data"
// table (an earlier, since-abandoned version of this fix used one - bB's
// "PF_dataN" naming, confirmed directly against Scroll3A.bas, already
// does exactly this job, matching that reference's structure exactly rather
// than reinventing it). A "playfield:" block is itself never executed when
// skipped over (same as a "data" table, same underlying JMP-over-the-bytes
// mechanism), and bB auto-names each one "PF_data0", "PF_data1", etc, in
// the order they're declared across the whole compiled program - this is
// the ONLY place in this codebase that ever emits a "playfield:" block
// (confirmed by searching the whole source tree), so that numbering is
// fully predictable: PF_data0 for backgrounds[0], PF_data1 for
// backgrounds[1], and so on, matching the array's declaration order.
//
// The copy itself is a small asm routine rather than bB's "playfield[i] =
// table[j]" assignment: confirmed by compiling both through the real
// toolchain, with Superchip RAM bB's "playfield:" loader writes to
// "playfield-128,x" (the Superchip's separate WRITE window - "playfield"
// itself is the READ window) but a "playfield[i] = ..." assignment emits "sta
// playfield,x", which writes into the read window (ROM) and silently does
// nothing, so no pixels ever showed.
//
// Registered into Blockly.BBasic.subroutines under
// BACKGROUND_SCROLL_PATCH_SUBROUTINE_NAME instead of being spliced directly
// into bank 1, so it rides the same bank-relocation machinery as a
// user-defined subroutine - see getSubroutineBank/generateRelocatedSections/
// pickRelocationCandidate in hooks/rom.js, the exact same machinery
// registerDistanceAbsDiffSubroutine (generators/bbasic/input.js) already
// rides. Every background_scroll call site resolves its gosub's bank-jump
// suffix via Blockly.BBasic.getSubroutineBank(BACKGROUND_SCROLL_PATCH_SUBROUTINE_NAME)
// instead of assuming bank 1.
//
// Every label DEFINITION below uses the "@" prefix (goto REFERENCES don't
// need it) because the registered body goes through generateSubroutineBody's
// normalizeIndents() pass, which otherwise indents every line flat,
// including bare labels - the same convention buildKeypadPollAsm/

// expects one. This was missing here entirely at first - a genuine,
// pre-existing bug (not introduced by any generator that fills in a
// function's  body), confirmed as the actual cause of a real
// "auto: failed" emulator crash: with no explicit terminator, the function's
// compiled body has nothing marking where it ends, corrupting whatever
// assembles right after it. "@end" (not a bare "end") for the same reason
// generateSubroutineBody's "@name" label uses it - normalizeIndents
// below indents every line by default, but a "@"-prefixed line has that
// prefix (and the indent it would otherwise get) stripped back to column 0
// in its  second pass, matching the same "data ${name}\n...\nend" shape
// unindented "end" lines already use everywhere else in this codebase.
//
// "return 0" unconditionally appended right before "@end" - a SECOND,
// independently real bug, exposed cleanly by a fully-disabled function body
// (no reachable function_return block left at all): unlike a subroutine
// (which always falls through into an auto-appended trailing "return" - see
// generateSubroutineBody), a function has NO implicit exit; it
// only ever exits via an explicit "return <value>" from a function_return
// block. A body with no reachable return at all (every function_return
// disabled/removed, or more generally any code path that doesn't end in
// one) falls straight through "end" into whatever's compiled right after it
// - confirmed directly against a real generated ROM: a function with
// everything inside disabled produced "function name\n  rem ...\nend" with
// no return statement anywhere, meaning calling it executes straight into
// the Data tables section as if it were code. A trailing "return 0" is
// always safe to add: unreachable dead code (a few bytes) whenever the
// user's  blocks already guarantee a return on every path, and the only
// thing standing between "call this function" and silently corrupting
// execution otherwise. (Not a bare "return" - see this generator's
