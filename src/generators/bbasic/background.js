// One subroutine PER OPERATION ACTUALLY USED (Set/Clear/Flip - see
// BACKGROUND_LINE_SUBROUTINE_NAMES below), not one shared routine with a
// runtime dispatch - a project using only "Set" line blocks (the common

// Still only ONE copy PER operation regardless of how many line blocks use
// it (see registerKeypadPollSubroutine's  identical "one shared copy,
// called via gosub" reasoning in generators/bbasic/input.js).
//
// The "err" term is tracked with a fixed +128 bias throughout (comparing
// against 128 instead of 0) rather than as a true signed value - this
// codebase's "dim"'d variables are plain unsigned bytes, and while
// ADD/SUBTRACT wrap correctly for negative values via ordinary two's-
// complement arithmetic, an UNSIGNED ">"/"<" comparison on a wrapped
// negative value reads it as a huge positive number instead, which would
// send the algorithm the wrong way at exactly the values where a plain sign
// check matters most. Biasing keeps every comparison safely within 0-255
// with no wraparound, as long as neither operand's  true magnitude ever
// approaches ~127 - true for every coordinate range this app's
// playfield editor (32 pixels wide, well under 127 tall even with Superchip
// RAM's  largest pfres) can ever produce.
//
// 7 dedicated dev vars: the current point (x1,y1), target point (x2,y2),
// distances (dx,dy), and the error accumulator - down from an earlier design
// that also had a loop counter and a runtime operation selector (9 vars).
// The loop counter turned out to be redundant: since x1 (low branch) or y1
// (high branch) already walks toward the target by exactly 1 every
// iteration, checking "have I just plotted the target point?" right after
// each plot is an equally valid stop condition, using state this routine
// already has to track anyway - see the "goto"-based loop below instead of
// the earlier "for/next" one. The operation selector is gone because the
// operation is now baked into which subroutine gets called (see above)
// instead of being read at runtime.
//
// An even earlier version tried to save vars a different way - keeping
// x1/y1/x2/y2/dx/dy in the shared temp1-temp6 scratch registers instead
// (the same ones background_change_pixel/background_change_hv_line use) -
// that was wrong, and a real reported bug (a couple of pixels drawn, then
// nothing, instead of a continuous line): pfpixel's implementation
// (public/bb19/includes/pf_drawing.asm's  setuppointers) uses temp1 AND
// temp2 as ITS internal scratch while computing the byte/row address -
// "stx temp2" / "sta temp1" - clobbering whatever this routine had stored
// there the instant the FIRST pfpixel call happened. background_change_pixel
// gets away with temp1/temp2 only because it uses them for one single,
// immediate call and never reads them again - safe for a one-shot hand-off,
// not for state that has to survive across a whole loop of repeated pfpixel
// calls. temp1/temp2 are still used here, but only as that same kind of
// momentary hand-off, immediately before each individual plot - x1/y1
// themselves live in their  dedicated vars.

  // frame for the SAME target color: unconditionally re-priming the timer
  // every time that happens meant the per-frame step
  // (generateBackgroundFadeChecks, which runs earlier in commongamelogic, so
  // its  progress got immediately overwritten right after) could never
  // actually count down to 0 - a real reported bug ("fade finished never
  // seems to trigger"; the fade itself never finishes, since it's
  // perpetually reset before it can), same class of bug (and same fix) as
  // buildTextScrollSetupLines' "same message, don't re-reset" guard in
  // text-scroll.js.
  //
  // Checking only targetVar (not the real color too, as this now does) was
  // confirmed as a real, separate reported bug: a "Fade to color" placed in
  // a one-shot event (Title screen start) that re-runs every time that
  // screen is re-entered, preceded by its "Set color" block resetting
  // the real color back to its starting value each time - targetVar still
  // held the PREVIOUS visit's already-reached target, so the guard kept
  // treating the fresh request as a no-op repeat and never restarted the
  // fade, even though the real color had genuinely just been reset away
  // from it. Comparing the real color too fixes this without needing to
  // know which kind of event the block was placed in: once a fade truly
  // settles (or was never running), the real color equals the target, so a
  // later request for that SAME target only re-arms when something has
  // since moved the real color away from it again.
  //
  // color is captured into temp1 exactly once, before either comparison,
  // rather than embedded directly into each "if" and the assignment - it
  // can be an arbitrary expression (not necessarily side-effect-free, e.g.
  // a Random block), and evaluating it more than once could disagree with
  // itself between the guard checks and the actual reset (same reasoning
  // random_between_set's "rand" capture uses in generators/bbasic/
  // random.js).

  // Hue stays on whatever it already was for the ENTIRE ramp, only
  // snapping to the target's hue on the exact step that lands brightness
  // on the target (or immediately, if brightness already matched the
  // target from the start - nothing to ramp at all). This was a deliberate
  // choice, not an oversight: the other order (snap hue to the target
  // immediately, ramp brightness afterward) was tried first and confirmed
  // to look worse in practice - many hues on this hardware render as
  // washed-out/grey at anything below full brightness, so ramping the
  // TARGET hue through low-to-mid brightness looked like the fade was
  // "turning greyscale" for most of its  duration before finally
  // becoming the right color at the end. Ramping the STARTING hue instead
  // means the color shown throughout is always a real, saturated color
  // (just not yet the target one) until the final step swaps it in.
  //
  // Direction (up or down) is decided FRESH on every step by comparing the
  // color's  CURRENT brightness against the target's, so one active
  // fade naturally reverses if retriggered toward a new target on the
  // other side of the current brightness - no separate "fade up"/"fade
  // down" state to keep in sync with reality.
  // Hand-written 6502 replacement for the bB if/goto chain checksForVar
  // below used to build for every fadeable register - COLUBK/COLUPF
  // (background/playfield) AND scorecolor/TextColor (score/text) all route
  // through this now. Not a mechanical translation: every
  // "(x & $0E)" the bB version recomputes from memory on each of its many
  // uses is instead loaded/masked ONCE into the accumulator and kept there
  // (or cached into temp2/temp3) across the branches that need it, and
  // 6502's  carry flag from CMP directly answers ">="/"<" without a
  // separate bB-style comparison-then-branch pair for each - real cycle
  // savings, not just fewer bB statements. temp2/temp3 are safe scratch
  // here for the same reason the bB version already relies on temp2 being
  // safe (see this whole function's  top comment): this runs directly in
  // commongamelogic, never inside a user Function body, so there's no
  // argument-passing collision risk (see function_param_get's  comment
  // in generators/bbasic/function.js for where THAT risk actually applies).
  //
  // Register discipline other branches below can rely on (confirmed
  // directly against 6502 semantics, not a guess): CMP/BCC/BCS/BEQ/BNE never
  // modify the accumulator, so falling through a branch that wasn't taken
  // leaves A holding whatever the immediately preceding CMP compared -
  // exploited below to skip a handful of redundant reloads.
  //
  // Every label is a plain global DASM symbol (no leading dot, matching
  // this file's  existing "_bgfadechk_<tag>_*" convention) - safe here
  // specifically BECAUSE this whole check is spliced into commongamelogic,
  // which is fixed, always-bank-1 content, never relocated the way
  // generators/bbasic/music.js's  relocatable musicEngine unit can be
  // (see that file's  comment on the real, confirmed "DASM Origin
  // Reverse-indexed" build failure a raw asm block hit ONLY once relocated
  // to a non-bank-1 position - this check's  fixed position sidesteps
  // that class of bug entirely, not just avoids repeating the mistake).
