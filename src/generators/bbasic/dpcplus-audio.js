// The DPC+ sound engine.
//
// The DPC+ kernel has a music chip: three voices, each a 32 sample waveform played at a pitch from the chip's
// frequency table, mixed into one number that the kernel copies to the TIA's volume register every scanline.
// Everything the app generates for sound and music (the Play sound block, Sound tab presets, the Music tab) is
// written for the TIA's two channels: a type (AUDC), a divider (AUDF) and a volume (AUDV) each. Under DPC+ the same
// generated code is kept, but its three values mean something else: AUDC is the number of a waveform (see
// dpc-sound.js: the shape drawn on the sound's card), AUDF is the pitch, an entry of the frequency table (the 88
// piano keys, then any other pitch a sound needs), and AUDV is the volume. The chip's registers can only be written, not
// read, so the pitch goes straight to the voice's note register and the waveform and the volume are written to two
// variables per voice instead. Once per frame a short routine turns those into the voice's waveform: when the waveform
// or the volume changed it rewrites the voice's 32 bytes of display RAM from the waveform's ROM copy scaled to the
// volume. What the voice's RAM holds is kept in the high nibbles of its first two bytes (the chip only plays the low
// nibble), so that costs no variable.
//
// The chip's voices are the channels 0, 2 and 3 (channel 1 is the TIA's), each its own channel for the music player and
// the sound blocks, so a sound effect can take a voice over from the music for a while and give it back, as on the
// TIA's two channels.
//
// The routine and its tables are an ordinary subroutine, so the project's bank layout can move them out of the bank
// with the game code, and the frequency table is a separate file in the display data bank.
